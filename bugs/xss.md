## What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?
Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise users' interactions with a vulnerable application.

## How does XSS work?
Cross-site scripting manipulates a vulnerable website to return malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

## XSS proof of concept
You can confirm most kinds of XSS vulnerability by injecting a payload that causes your browser to execute some arbitrary JavaScript. It's long been common practice to use the alert() function for this purpose because it's short, harmless, and pretty hard to miss when it's successfully called.
Unfortunately, there's a slight hitch if you use Chrome. From version 92 onward (July 20th, 2021), cross-origin iframes are prevented from calling alert(). As these are used to construct some of the more advanced XSS attacks, you'll sometimes need to use an alternative PoC payload. In this scenario, we recommend the print() function.

## What are the types of XSS attacks?
There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

- Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
- Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
- DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

### Reflected cross-site scripting
Reflected XSS is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting. It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.

Here is a simple example of a reflected XSS vulnerability:
```
https://insecure-website.com/status?message=All+is+well.
<p>Status: All is well.</p>
```

The application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can easily construct an attack like this:
```
https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>
<p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>
```

If the user visits the URL constructed by the attacker, then the attacker's script executes in the user's browser, in the context of that user's session with the application. At that point, the script can carry out any action, and retrieve any data, to which the user has access.

### Stored cross-site scripting
Stored XSS (also known as persistent or second-order XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.

The data in question might be submitted to the application via HTTP requests; for example, comments on a blog post, user nicknames in a chat room, or contact details on a customer order. In other cases, the data might arrive from other untrusted sources; for example, a webmail application displaying messages received over SMTP, a marketing application displaying social media posts, or a network monitoring application displaying packet data from network traffic.

Here is a simple example of a stored XSS vulnerability. A message board application lets users submit messages, which are displayed to other users:

```
<p>Hello, this is my message!</p>
```
The application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can easily send a message that attacks other users:

```
<p><script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>
```

### DOM-based cross-site scripting
DOM-based XSS (also known as DOM XSS) arises when an application contains some client-side JavaScript that processes data from an untrusted source in an unsafe way, usually by writing the data back to the DOM.

In the following example, an application uses some JavaScript to read the value from an input field and write that value to an element within the HTML:

```
var search = document.getElementById('search').value;
var results = document.getElementById('results');
results.innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;
```
If the attacker can control the value of the input field, they can easily construct a malicious value that causes their own script to execute:

```
You searched for: <img src=1 onerror='/* Bad stuff here... */'>
```
In a typical case, the input field would be populated from part of the HTTP request, such as a URL query string parameter, allowing the attacker to deliver an attack using a malicious URL, in the same manner as reflected XSS.

## What can XSS be used for?
An attacker who exploits a cross-site scripting vulnerability is typically able to:

- Impersonate or masquerade as the victim user.
- Carry out any action that the user is able to perform.
- Read any data that the user is able to access.
- Capture the user's login credentials.
- Perform virtual defacement of the website.
- Inject trojan functionality into the website.

## Impact of XSS vulnerabilities
The actual impact of an XSS attack generally depends on the nature of the application, its functionality and data, and the status of the compromised user. For example:

- In a brochureware application, where all users are anonymous and all information is public, the impact will often be minimal.
- In an application holding sensitive data, such as banking transactions, emails, or healthcare records, the impact will usually be serious.
- If the compromised user has elevated privileges within the application, then the impact will generally be critical, allowing the attacker to take full control of the vulnerable application and compromise all users and their data.
